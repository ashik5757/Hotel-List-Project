# Hotel List Project

A full-stack application that combines a **React + Tailwind CSS frontend** with a **Django backend** to assist users in smart decision-making and navigation. The system processes data in real-time and provides guidance to users through a clean and interactive interface.

---

## Project Description

This project is designed to simulate a smart assistant system that helps users navigate or make decisions based on environmental and system data. The **frontend** handles user interaction and display, while the **backend** processes logic, decision-making, and data handling. The architecture is modular and extendable to integrate machine learning models in the future.
